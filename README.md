# Decision-Tree-Classifier-on-Titanic-Dataset
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier using Python and the Titanic dataset. It involves data preprocessing such as handling missing values, label encoding, and feature selection. The correlation between features is visualized using heatmaps, and the dataset is analyzed through histograms and pair plots. A Decision Tree and Logistic Regression model are trained and evaluated using cross-validation and various metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The project compares the performance of both models to predict passenger survival rates.
